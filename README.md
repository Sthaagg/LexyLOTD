Add support to Lexy's Legacy of the Dragonborn: Special Edition
Important notice
As it is a small guide deviation, Do it at very late, after checking if everything works as it should.

Each patches must be installed under is normal counterpart except Experience's one.

Installation
You will need to install patch from the mod Complete Widescreen Fix for Vanilla and SkyUI 2.2 and 5.2 SE. (Don't forget to endorse it)

Complete Widescreen Fix for SkyUI 5.2 SE Alpha - 2560x1080
Experience - Widescreen fix (merge with previous one)
SkyUI SE - Flashing Savegames FIx - Widescreen Fix
Opt. 1 - Wider MCM Menu for SkyUI - Widescreen Fix
Better MessageBox Control Widescreen Fix
Campfire 1.12.1 and Frostall 3.4.1SE - Unofficial SSE Widescreen Fix
Replace dialoguemenu.cfg content by content of the one uploaded here

You will need to adjust frostfall mcm value, as the ones given by the guide don't fit well with an UW screen, same with Matter of time.

(I will give mine on next update)
